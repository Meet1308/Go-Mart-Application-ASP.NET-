This is My College Final year project. It is on Online Shopping Mart Project . I give Go_Mart Application name to it. In this Project I use ASP.NET Framework with MVC structure and SQL server Database. First Login page is appeared when we run it. There are two moduls in this Seller and Admin both are login by seprate Username and Password. After Login First Welcome Page Display with One Nav-bar with Different Moduls Category,Products,Report, Add User, About us and Exit. In these module there are different nav-bars for seller and admin they both do different tasks. Admin can access all these Moduls when Seller can Only access Only Three Properties Like Product,About us , Exit. Seller can not add any Other Seller and Admin.
